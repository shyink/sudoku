# Sudoku Solver

It's a standard Maven project. Build using "mvn clean install".
I've included my run configs for building and running the project.  Place any new puzzles in to the puzzles directory.
If you wish to change the location of the puzzle and solution directory, it can updated in the application.properties file.
